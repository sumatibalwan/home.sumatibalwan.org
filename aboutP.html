            <b class="bold">Dr. (Mrs.) Sharayu Ghole,</b> a dedicated gynecologist, has been running a hospital in
            Dhankawadi, Pune, since 1977. Inspired by the teachings of Swami Vivekananda and driven by a deep sense of
            gratitude toward society, Dr. Ghole, along with Dr. M.N. Hardikar and other like-minded individuals, came
            together with a vision to make a meaningful contribution to society. This collective effort led to the
            establishment of the "Radhabai Hardikar Pranijat Mangal Sanstha" Trust.

          <p class="block">
            The journey began over 30 years ago with the opening of a small dispensary and hospital in
            Nimbalkarwadi-Gujarwadi, then small hamlets under the Katraj Gram Panchayat. The location was chosen due to
            the lack of medical facilities and public transport in the area, addressing a critical need in the
            community.

        <div class="one-about">
          <p class="block">
            Encouraged by the success of these initiatives, the Trust took a significant step forward in 1999 by
            founding an orphanage with a difference. Unlike traditional institutions, this orphanage was designed to
            provide a true "home" for the 25 children who live there, ensuring they grow up in a nurturing and
            supportive environment.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="one-about">
          <p class="block">
            To provide these children, and others from nearby villages, with quality education, the Trust established a
            charitable school, <b>Sumati Balwan</b>, in 2001. This school currently educates 650 students from
            Kindergarten to 10th grade and offers a unique learning experience. The focus is on holistic education,
            where children learn amidst nature through play, dance, singing, and by discovering and nurturing their
            innate talents.

        <div class="one-about">
          <p class="block">
            Additionally, to equip students with practical skills, the school introduced the <b>Introduction to Basic
              Technology (IBT)</b> program for students from 8th to 10th grade, fostering independence and
            self-sufficiency.
