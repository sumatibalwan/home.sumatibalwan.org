                    In 2019, 5-year-old Jyoti was brought to Pakharmaya after her mother,
                    desperate to escape the relentless beatings and abuse by her husband,
                    sought refuge for her daughter. Pakharmaya, a sanctuary for orphaned and
                    vulnerable children, became the safe haven where Jyoti finally found the
                    love and support she desperately needed. Soon after her arrival, Jyoti's
                    remarkable potential began to shine. A true all-rounder, she excelled in
                    academics and sports alike, displaying exceptional talent and
                    determination. Her passion for kickboxing, kabaddi, karate, and
                    adventure activities like wall climbing quickly set her apart. Under the
                    guidance of her dedicated coaches, Jyoti's hard work and tenacity led
                    her to secure a silver medal at the state level and a bronze at the
                    national level in kickboxing, filling everyone at Pakharmaya with pride.
                    Jyoti's story is a powerful testament to resilience and the
                    transformative power of a caring community. It proves that even the most
                    vulnerable can rise above their circumstances and achieve greatness.
