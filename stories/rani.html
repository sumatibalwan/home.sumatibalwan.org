                    In 2007, 3-year-old Rani Shinde was rescued from an abusive home and brought to Pakharmaya, where
                    she found a new beginning. Surrounded by love and support, Rani grew into a compassionate and
                    capable young woman. She discovered her true passions in cooking and agriculture. She personally
                    takes care of all the domestic animals, looks after the cows, and feeds them.

                    Rani chose to stay with Pakharmaya, contributing as a food instructor and managing the farm. She
                    also launched a small business making traditional snacks, which gained popularity and allowed her to
                    support herself while contributing financially to Pakharmaya. Today, Rani is a beloved member of the
                    Pakharmaya family, embodying independence and resilience. Her journey from a rescued child to a
                    self-sufficient woman highlights the transformative power of a nurturing environment and the pursuit
                    of one's passions.
