                <p class="para-con">
                    A girl who is probably stepping out of her teens now, whose age can only be guessed and
                    surmised.
                    A girl with a winning smile and a happy heart.
                    A girl who loves life.

                    And yet, life has not always been kind to her.
                    An NGO Rescued a group of small children begging on the streets of Pune, where they "worked" for
                    a
                    contractor who fed them barely Enough to survive but plied them through the day with
                    hallucinogenic
                    drugs to make them do his bidding.

                    This heartless man had been on the verge of sending some of the
                    small girls for further exploitation of a horrendous type.
                    They were rescued from his clutches in the nick of time.

                    Seventeen years ago, three of these half-starved children were Brought to Sumati Balwan and we
                    took
                    them in. Kajal was one of them.

                    Had she been stolen from her parents some years ago by that cruel contractor? Or had she been
                    abandoned? She knows not and nor do we.

                    Ensconced securely in our care, she gradually overcame her physical and emotional handicaps and
                    joined our other children in school.

                    Over the years she blossomed into a strong and sturdy child. She immersed herself in Studies, she
                    loved and excelled in Sports. She has won many medals in wall climbing ,participated at National
                    level competitions.
                    Today she is a volunteer coach to college students in adventure sports like rapelling.

                    She is a good and industrious student too and has secured 76.5% in the HSc examination held this
                    year.
                    She now stands poised to take the next step and has started the first year of BCA.

                    Aided by us, in January 2024 she completed Basic Mountaineering Course conducted by GGIM and
                    passed
                    it with an A Grade. She would now like to do a one-year Diploma in Mountaineering affiliated
                    to the
                    Savitribai Phule University of Pune.
                    The fees for the Mountaineering course are Rs 90000/-and BCA : Rs.50000/-

                    I am reaching out to you to ask, will you too, be willing to be a part of the incredible success
                    story Kajal has scripted and worked hard for, in her life?
                    Will you join us in celebrating and helping her future journey in life?
                    A life which began as a fight for survival on the harsh streets of Pune but has overcome all
                    odds to
                    reach for the sky on a mountain top?
