                    In 2018, 10-year-old Sakshi Shinde was rescued from a life of hardship, having been abandoned by her
                    family and
                    left to suffer under the care of her alcoholic father. When she arrived at Pakhrmaya, an orphanage
                    dedicated to
                    giving hope to children without families, she carried the weight of a painful past. Though academics

                    challenge for her, Sakshi discovered a fierce passion for sports, especially karate and kabaddi,
                    where her
                    determination and resilience quickly set her apart.
                    Despite her struggles, Sakshi's dedication led her to excel in sports, winning gold at the state
                    level and
                    bronze at the national level in karate. Now in the 9th standard, she continues to thrive as a
                    talented athlete,
                    embodying the spirit of hope and perseverance. Sakshi Shindeâ€™s journey from a vulnerable child to a
                    celebrated
                    athlete is a powerful reminder of what can be achieved with love, support, and an unwavering
